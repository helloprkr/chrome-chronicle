## üß© Technical Details

### How It Works

<div align="center">

![Architecture Diagram](./images/architecture.png)

</div>

ChromeChronicle works by:

1. Creating a temporary copy of Chrome's SQLite history database
2. Querying for URLs visited on the current day
3. Converting Chrome's timestamp format (microseconds since Jan 1, 1601)
4. Formatting the data into a readable markdown table
5. Organizing files by year and month
