# ChromeChronicle: Automatic Chrome History in Markdown Files

I built a tool called ChromeChronicle that automatically saves your daily Chrome browsing history as beautiful markdown files, organized by month.

## Why I built it
I wanted to keep track of websites I visited for research and projects, but couldn't remember where I found certain information days or weeks later. Manual bookmarking was inconsistent, and Chrome's history search isn't great for browsing by date.

## How it works
- Uses Python to query Chrome's SQLite history database
- Creates a temporary copy to avoid locking issues
- Converts Chrome's timestamps to readable format
- Formats everything in clean markdown tables
- Organizes files by year-month: `2025-03/2025-03-07_URL-History.md`
- Runs automatically every day via macOS LaunchD

## Features
- ðŸ”„ Daily automation (set it and forget it)
- ðŸ“Š Beautiful markdown format
- ðŸ“‚ Organized by date
- ðŸ”’ Privacy-focused (stays on your machine)
- ðŸ“± Lightweight (minimal resource usage)

The code is open source and available on GitHub: github.com/yourusername/ChromeChronicle
